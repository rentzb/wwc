# wwc

The WWC R package aims to provide some useful helper functions for education researchers aiming to meet the U.S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences' What Works Clearinghouse standards. The package is a work in progress, but currently provides basic functions for determining baseline equivalence for quasi-experimental design (QED) studies that use propensity score matching with the `MatchIt` R package. More features are planned to be added.

## Installation

You can install the development version of the wwc package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("rentzb/wwc")
```
