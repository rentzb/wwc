The WWC R package aims to provide some useful helper functions for
education researchers aiming to meet the U.S. Department of Education’s
Institute of Education Sciences’ What Works Clearinghouse standards. The
package is a work in progress, but currently provides basic functions
for determining baseline equivalence for quasi-experimental design (QED)
studies that use propensity score matching with the `MatchIt` R package.
More features are planned to be added.

## Installation

You can install the development version of the wwc package from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("rentzb/wwc")
```
